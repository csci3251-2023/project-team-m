# Introduction
Our team starts by creating **issues** from the `issues` folder. These issues contains tasks for each member. The issues are lablled, continously monitored and closed whenever done. The issues are also divided into multiple categories - "To do", "In Progress", and "Done" depending on their progress. A project board is also created from sratch and the Issues and Pull requests are marked with the project board. Then our team writes a sample code in C and set up a GitHub Action with a workflow (e.g., C/C++ with Make) to run the C code. Furthermore, we add the code (with syntax highlight) to the documentation (readme.md) using `include_relative` and add a status badge to the code. We will also showcase our team by adding information (image, user, name, content) about each team member to our project page. Finally, we will register our repo and add a link to it on the main CSCI3251-2023 organization page.
